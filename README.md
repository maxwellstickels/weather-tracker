## Overview

The Weather Tracker allows users to search for current weather and 5-day future forecasts in any city by searching for that city's name using the provided input box. The weather conditions included are the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. The 5 most recent search terms are saved to local storage and displayed on the screen. Clicking on any of the recent search terms will bring up the weather conditions for that search term. Users should provide accurate names for the locations they would like to search - the current build does not support autocorrect functionality.

## Programs Used
